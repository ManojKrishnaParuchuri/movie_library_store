ABOUT PROJECT:-
------------------
The project creation starts with the User signup and then Login. For that login there is authentication. So the details which are used while Signup as verified and checked whether they are
matched with the login credentials or not.
Then there will be the Home page. With the search option and the playlist option. The Search functionality is implemented with preventDefault. And to get the data of the movies, we used OMDB
API. Used OMDB API and key for getting the details of the movie and the Search is working fine

Later the user, if he clicks the card of the movie , he can see the details of the movie .. with the Titlw, year, country, Rating of the movie in IMDB, Poster of the Movie , Actors.

There are two butons to go back and add to the PlayList. If he clicks on the button of Add to PlayList, then it will be rendered to the PlayList page and there will be button called
as Save playlist. If it is clicked then the Movies will be saved to the data base under playlists folder.

There will be go back button so he can come back to home page.

In the LoginPage there will be the contact page where my contact details are present with LinkedIn, GitHub and my Portfolio
